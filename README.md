## Just a goof

Mostly inspired by a font I stumbled across, created by [Ben Bittner](https://surlyben.itch.io/).
He calls it [Vectorhand](https://surlyben.itch.io/vectorhand)

I had a retro-gaming joke in mind already, but it was based on Atari 2600 Hangman. When I found
Ben's Asteroids-inspired font I thought 'I can re-purpose my dumb joke into this _other_ dumb joke.'
